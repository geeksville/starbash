# (Not yet implemented)
# The creator of this image session
# (if not present this section will be auto generated at processing time)
# this whole secion is auto copied from userprefs.sb.toml
# The format of this session is compatible with the Citation File Format (CFF)
# see https://github.com/citation-file-format/citation-file-format/blob/main/schema-guide.md
# for details.
# The only difference is to facilitate toml parsing we use an = sign instead of :
# if/when .cff file exports are required we'll do that conversion then.






# Summary information for each session processed.  Included with sessions is [stages] which allows per session
# recipe exclusions/inclusions to be specified.
