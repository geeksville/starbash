Hi ya'll,

So for the last few weeks I've been working on a python tool to automate much of astrophotography processing.  i.e: point it at your huge repo of raw images and it will automatically generate a structured output repo of stacked (even with fancy dual-filter, multisession) images.  Ready for immediate viewing or further processing.

Here's a blurb I just stole from the [README](https://github.com/geeksville/starbash/blob/main/README.md):

> A tool for automating/standardizing/sharing astrophotography workflows.

* Automatic - with sensible defaults that you can change as needed.
* Easy - provides a 'seestar-like' starting point for autoprocessing all your sessions (by default).
* Fast - even with large image repositories. Automatic master bias and flat generation and reasonable defaults.
* Multi-session - by default. So your workflows can stack from multiple nights (and still use the correct flats etc...).
* Shareable - you can share/use recipes for image preprocessing flows.

This project is currently very 'alpha' and missing recipes for some workflows, but adding new recipes is easy and I'm happy to help.  Over the next couple of months I think the remaining items on the [TODO](https://github.com/geeksville/starbash/blob/main/TODO.md) list will be completed.

Please please please if you are willing to try this and report back in either the github or this thread, I'd be super grateful.  The installation is pretty easy (if you have python) - the README has crude instructions and sample 'videos':
