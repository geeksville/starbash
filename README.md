A tool for automating/standardizing/sharing astrophotography workflows.

* Automatic - with sensible defaults, that you can change as needed.
* Easy - provides a 'seestar like' starting-point for autoprocessing all your sessions (by default).
* Fast - even with large image repositories.  Automatic master bias and flat generation and reasonable defaults
* Sharable - you can share/use recipes for image preprocessing flows.

(This project is currently 'alpha' and missing recipes for some workflows, but adding new recipes is easy and we're happy to help.  Please file a github issue if your images are not auto-processed and we'll work out a fix.)

# Current status

Not quite ready ðŸ˜Š.  But making good progress.

See the current [TODO](TODO.md) file for work items.  I'll be looking for pre-alpha testers/feedback soon.

## Current features

* Automatically recognizes and auto-parses the default NINA, Asiair and Seestar raw file repos (adding support for other layouts is easy)
* Multisession support by default (including automatic selection of correct flats, biases and dark frames)
* 'Repos' can contain raw files, generated masters, preprocessed files, or recipes.

## Features coming soon

* Automatically performs **complete** preprocessing on OSC (broadband, narrowband or dual Duo filter), Mono (LRGB, SHO) data.  i.e. give you 'seestar level' auto-preprocessing, so you only need to do the (optional) custom post-processing.
* Generates a per target report/config file which can be customized if the detected defaults or preprocessing are not what you want
* 'Recipes' provide repeatable/human-readable/sharable descriptions of all processing steps
* Repos can be on the local disk or shared via HTTPS/github/etc.  This is particularly useful for recipe repos
* Uses Siril and Graxpert for its pre-processing operations (support for Pixinsight based recipes will probably be coming at some point...)
* The target report can be used to auto generate a human friendly 'postable/sharable' report about that image
* Target reports are sharable so that you can request comments by others and others can rerender with different settings

## Installing

Currently the easiest way to install this command-line based tool is to install is via [pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/).  If you don't already have pipx and you have python installed, you can auto install it by running "pip install --user pipx."  If you don't have python installed see the pipx link for pipx installers for any OS.

Once pipx is installed just run the following **two** commands (the sb --install-completion will make TAB auto-complete automatically complete sb options (for most platforms)):

```
âžœ pipx install starbash
  installed package starbash 0.1.3, installed using Python 3.12.3
  These apps are now globally available
    - sb
    - starbash
done! âœ¨ ðŸŒŸ âœ¨

âžœ sb --install-completion
bash completion installed in /home/.../sb.sh
Completion will take effect once you restart the terminal

```

FIXME - add getting started instructions (possibly with a screenshare video)

## Supported commands

### Repository Management
- `sb repo list [--verbose]` - List installed repos (use `-v` for details)
- `sb repo add [--master] <filepath|URL>` - Add a repository, optionally specifying the type
- `sb repo remove <REPONUM>` - Remove the indicated repo from the repo list
- `sb repo reindex [--force] [REPONUM]` - Reindex the specified repo (or all repos if none specified)

### User Preferences
- `sb user name "Your Name"` - Set name for attribution in generated images
- `sb user email "foo@example.com"` - Set email for attribution in generated images
- `sb user analytics <on|off>` - Turn analytics collection on/off
- `sb user reinit` - Configure starbash via a brief guided process

### Selection & Filtering
- `sb select` - Show information about the current selection
- `sb select list` - List sessions (filtered based on the current selection)
- `sb select any` - Remove all filters (select everything)
- `sb select target <TARGETNAME>` - Limit selection to the named target
- `sb select telescope <TELESCOPENAME>` - Limit selection to the named telescope
- `sb select date <after|before|between> <DATE> [DATE]` - Limit to sessions in the specified date range
- `sb select export SESSIONNUM DESTDIR` - Export the images for indicated session number into the specified directory (or current directory if not specified).  If possible symbolic links are used, if not the files are copied.

### Selection information
- `sb info` - Show user preferences location and other app info
- `sb info target` - List targets (filtered based on the current selection)
- `sb info telescope` - List instruments (filtered based on the current selection)
- `sb info filter` - List all filters found in current selection

## Not yet supported commands

### Export & Processing
- `sb process siril [--run] SESSIONNUM DESTDIR` - Generate Siril directory tree and optionally run Siril GUI
- `sb process auto [SESSIONNUM]` - Automatic processing.  If session # is specified process only that session, otherwise all selected sessions will be processed
- `sb process masters` - Generate master flats, darks, and biases from available raw frames in the current selection

## Supported tools (now)

* Siril
* Graxpert
* Python (you can add python code to recipes if necessary)

## Supported tools (future?)

* Pixinsight?
* Autostakkert?

## Developing
